Sadly I do not have exact text of these questions so I will just some up the main idea. In both cases the test environment and classes were premade and I only had to insert my solution. Question 1 was basic element occourence counting, question 2 tested basics of inheritance.

## Question 1
From given count of sold products and names (fe: 3 shirt shirt box) return most sold product. In case of tie return the last one alphabetically.   
1 < N < 10^4

## Question 2
From the given abstract class and uml diagram create classes that inherit and add mileage parameter that can be obtained as a string with given description and is set with only parameter in constructor. All additional properties of base class are not to be set by constructor but has to be available after creation and are given by question text.
